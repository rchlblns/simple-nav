# Simple Navigation Menu
[View the finished project here!](https://rchlblns.github.io/simple-nav/)

## The Task
The challenge was to create a navigation menu without using any CSS frameworks. The menu should include four links (HOME, INVENTORY, ABOUT US, CONTACT) and when INVENTORY is clicked, a dropdown should reveal the following items: NEW, USED, CARS, TRUCKS, and SUVS.  

## Design Considerations
I chose to design the navigation menu in a horizontal pattern at the top of the page. As a familiar pattern to users, it aligns with user expectation of where site navigation should be. In that same spirit, the second level menu was also designed in a horizontal layout for consistency. The main focus for the submenu design was minimal interaction cost and high discoverability. The inventory link features a visual indicator for users to quickly find the subnavigation menu and access it with a single click. Then, upon interaction, the subnav slides down revealing a horizontal layout that allows users to view all submenu links at once.  

## Languages/Libraries Used
* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript
* JQuery

## How To Setup/Run
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/rchlblns/simple-nav.git`
2. cd into repo
3. Open files in your code editor & view HTML file in browser

## Next Steps
The scope of this project is quite small as it is a coding challenge. In a bigger project, I would implement the following:

1. Better responsiveness - I would likely create a hamburger menu with a vertical layout that's triggered by paticular screen sizes. 
2. Cleaner transitions & more clear user feedback
